# Adding a new component to KhulnaSoft UI

The following provides guidance for engineers adding new components to KhulnaSoft UI.

## Merge Request guidelines

Create a Merge Request in KhulnaSoft UI with your new component code. Use the
commit message `feat([ComponentName]): Implement [ComponentName] component`.
This creates a conventional commit used by the
[npm release CI job](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-ui/pipelines) to
create a new version of the KhulnaSoft UI package.

Run the manual CI job (`update_screenshots`) to generate the baseline snapshots used by the visual
tests. You can find it in last stage of
[KhulnaSoft UI CI pipeline](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-ui/pipelines).
This CI job commits the baseline snapshot images to the merge request branch.

### How to keep merge requests small

New components are usually introduced in a single, large MR.

To simplify the review process, create a principal feature branch based on the project's main branch.
Then, create smaller branches targeting the principal branch to iterate through smaller changes.

## Working on a Pajamas-documented component

If you are adding or updating a component documented in the
[Pajamas design system](https://design.gitlab.com), you should comply with the
[component lifecycle workflow](https://design.gitlab.com/get-started/lifecycle).
