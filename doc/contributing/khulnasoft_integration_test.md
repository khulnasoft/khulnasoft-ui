# Testing KhulnaSoft UI changes in KhulnaSoft

When introducing major, or potentially breaking changes in KhulnaSoft UI, you might want to verify that
they properly integrate in KhulnaSoft before they are released in a new `@khulnasoft/ui` version.

This can be done either by building the `@khulnasoft/ui` package locally, or by using the package that
is built every time a pipeline runs against your branch.

See [Updating KhulnaSoft UI Packages](doc/updating-khulnasoft-ui-packages.md) for information on how the
`@khulnasoft/ui` package is kept up to date in various other projects.

## Testing your changes in a local KhulnaSoft instance

During development, you can use [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) to  link your local
`@khulnasoft/ui` package changes to the KhulnaSoft project.
This means you don't need to update `package.json`, and can easily test changes.

1. Install `yalc` with `yarn global add yalc`
1. Navigate to the `@khulnasoft/ui` directory and publish the package with `yalc publish`.
1. Navigate to the `gitlab` project and add published package with `yalc add @khulnasoft/ui`.
1. Run `yarn install --check-files` to pull package updates.

To propagate changes in the `@khulnasoft/ui` project automatically to all installations use
the following command `yalc publish --push`.

## Using the remote development package

This approach relies on the development package that's built and published as an artifact by the
`build_package` CI job. This is especially useful if the changes you are making in KhulnaSoft UI require
some code to be migrated in KhulnaSoft as you will be able to open a KhulnaSoft MR to preemptively integrate
your changes before they are released with a new version of `@khulnasoft/ui`.

Your development flow would then look like this:

1. Push your changes to KhulnaSoft UI.
1. A development package is built by the `build_package` job.
1. Create a new branch in KhulnaSoft and install the development package.
1. Do any required migration in the KhulnaSoft branch, push it and open an MR against it.
1. Get your KhulnaSoft UI _and_ KhulnaSoft MRs reviewed.
1. Get the KhulnaSoft UI MR merged.
1. A new version of `@khulnasoft/ui` containing your changes is released.
1. Update the KhulnaSoft MR to use the newly released version of `@khulnasoft/ui` instead of the development
   build.
1. Get your KhulnaSoft MR merged.

To help with this process, KhulnaSoft UI exposes a `create_integration_branch` manual CI job that will
automatically create (or update) an integration branch and install the `@khulnasoft/ui` development build.

You would then only need to create a new Merge Request from that branch by following the link at
the end of the `create_integration_branch` job's output.

Once you create the KhulnaSoft integration Merge Request, add a note to the KhulnaSoft UI Merge Request
with a link pointing to it. This way, the reviewers can use the integration Merge Request to run
their own verifications.

## The KhulnaSoft UI Integrations fork

When running the `create_integration_branch` CI job, integration branches are created
in a [fork of KhulnaSoft](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/khulnasoft-ui-integrations).
The fork is set up to mirror the `master` branch from the KhulnaSoft repository.
We are using a fork to circumvent issues where pushing directly to the KhulnaSoft repository could
time out. Therefore, keep in mind that the fork might be slightly behind the upstream branch
between mirroring schedules. When working with such branches in your GDK, also bear in mind that
changes need to be pushed to the fork, not the KhulnaSoft repository.

### How is the fork set up to mirror KhulnaSoft?

The repository mirroring is set up as a push mirror from the KhulnaSoft project. Push events
are authored by a bot user associated with a Project Access Token created in the fork.

Since Project Access Tokens eventually expire, the mirror needs to be set up again from
time to time. This requires maintainer access to both KhulnaSoft and the KhulnaSoft UI Integrations
projects. Here's how the mirroring should be configured:

1. Create a Project Access Token with the `Developer` role and `write_repository` scope in the
   [KhulnaSoft UI Integrations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/khulnasoft-ui-integrations/-/settings/access_tokens)
   project.
1. Give the PAT's user permission to push to the `master` branch in the
   [repository settings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/khulnasoft-ui-integrations/-/settings/repository).
1. In the [KhulnaSoft](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/-/settings/repository#js-push-remote-settings)
   project, remove the outdated mirroring configuration if any. Make sure you're _only_ removing
   KhulnaSoft UI Integrations mirrors.
1. Create a new mirroring configuration with the following settings:
    * **Git repository URL**: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/khulnasoft-ui-integrations.git`.
    * **Mirror direction**: `Push`.
    * **Username**: The PAT's username.
    * **Password**: The PAT.
    * **Mirror branches**:
        * `Mirror specific branches`: `^master$`.
