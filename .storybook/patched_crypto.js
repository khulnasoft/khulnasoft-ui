/**
 * Webpack 4 uses md4 internally because it is fast.
 * Some loaders also use md5 directly.
 * Node >= 17 ships with OpenSSL@3 by default, which dropped support for md4
 *
 * This is a hack to monkey patch the crypto function to use
 * another algorithm if md4 or md5 is expected.

 * https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/13572#issuecomment-923736472
 *
 * This hack can be removed once we upgrade to webpack v5 as
 * it includes native support for configuring hash options:
