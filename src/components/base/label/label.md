Labels are editable objects that allow users to manually categorize other objects, like issues,
merge requests, and epics. They have a name, description, and a customizable background color.
They provide a quick way to recognize which categories the labeled object belongs to.

## Using the component

```js
<gl-label
  background-color="#D9C2EE"
  title="Label content"
  description="Some content"
  tooltipPlacement="top"
  target="http://some.url"
/>
```
