// conditional overrides for dark mode for use in storybook.
// Because we only use application.css from gitlab (and not
// application_dark), we need to override some base rules so
// that we can more easily test components in dark mode

// This is because dark mode in gitlab currently depends on
// overriding SCSS variables, but we want khulnasoft-ui dark mode
// to use Custom Properties instead

  --gl-text-color: #{$gray-50};
  --white: #{$gray-900}; // define mapping between the colours in dark mode. I have used the values from KhulnaSoft for consistency: https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/-/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/themes/_dark.scss
